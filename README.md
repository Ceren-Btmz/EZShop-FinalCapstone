Welcome to the Easy Shop Application! EasyShop Version 2 is an e-commerce application designed to enhance the online shopping experience. As a backend developer, the project involves fixing existing bugs, introducing new features, and improving overall functionality.

# User Stories 📝

User stories are concise, user-centric descriptions of a feature or functionality in a software system. They capture the requirements from the perspective of end-users and are often written in plain language. Each user story represents a piece of functionality that delivers value to the user.

2. Compile and run the file


3. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the application.


4. Testing: Utilize Postman to test API endpoints. Access the integrated frontend to visualize and test the API's functionality on the web.


# Technologies Used ⚙ ⚒

1. **Java:** The core programming language used for developing the application. Java's versatility and object-oriented features contribute to the robustness of the codebase.


2. **Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOP):** OOP principles are employed throughout the development process, ensuring a modular and scalable architecture. Classes and interfaces are used to model the components of the system.


3.  **IntelliJ IDEA (or Eclipse):** Utilized IntelliJ IDEA as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and project management. The features of the IDE enhance productivity and code quality.


4. **Git:** Utilized Git as the version control system for tracking changes, managing branches, and enabling collaborative development.


5.  **Spring Boot:** A Java-based framework used for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.


6. **Spring:** The broader Spring Framework provides comprehensive infrastructure support and a set of reusable modules for developing enterprise-level applications in Java.


7. **MySQL:** A widely used relational database management system. Provides a robust and scalable solution for storing and retrieving data.


8. **Maven:** A build automation and project management tool. Manages project dependencies, facilitates building, and simplifies the overall development process.
